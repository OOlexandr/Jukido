# Jukido
The name Jukido (**銃器道**) is a play on words. Bushido (**武士道**) is a samurai moral code or "the way (do) of the warrior (bushi)". Juki (**銃器**) is a pistol or a small firearm. So Jukido can be translated as "the way of the gun".
Playable character's name is (**珠希**) which is pronounced as Juki. Convenient, isn't it?
The game was largely inspired by these two posts:

As both katana and revolver users are often depicted in popular culture practicing "draw-attack-sheath" fighting style it is only natural that the one who uses both would take this practice to extreme. He would walk the battlefield empty handed while at any moment being able to attack. And as it is rather difficult to block or parry while your blade is in the sheath he would have to rely on speed to outmaneuver his enemies and stay out of reach.

# Gameflow
The basic gameflow is based on the "Cuphead bossfight" theme. The player character is placed in a 2D arena with a boss. The boss attacks the player or summons minions and the player fights back. If player character's or boss's health drops to zero the game ends with defeat or victory respectively. After this the game can be restarted by pressing R or exited by pressing Esc. Pressing Esc also ends the game in while in the middle of bossfight.

# Game mechanics
The Juki can move with constant speed using A and D buttons and jump using Space. He moves faster then his enemies an can kite them. It might be possible to kite a single weaker enemy indefinitely but this is not the way of the warrior.

If player presses left mouse button Juki in a single motion draws his katana and attacks and sheathes. He attacks to the left if mouse cursor is to the left of him or to the right otherwise.
If player initiates a new attack (presses LMB) before the last one is over Juki will make one more slash before sheathing. In this manner he can do series of up to three slashes.
The final attack in the series deals more damage. Stronger draw kills weaker enemies in a single hit while the following slashes - in two. This means that if Juki finds himself surrounded he can kill the first enemy then kill the second one with the final hit of the series like in somewhat nerfed version of "standoff" from Ghost of Tsushima
Dealing damage with katana replenishes rounds in revolver, up to six rounds.

If player presses right mouse button Juki draws his revolver and fires towards cursor. This launches a projectile that deals damage on contact. Due to Juki's dedication to his craft and namesake he has learned to shoot his revolver as fast as the player can press RMB. However he cannot fire the revolver while the sword is drawn.
The revolver can only hold six rounds and Juki has to deal damage with katana to replenish them.

At the moment the game has a single bossfight with the pirate captain as pirates are as close to being polar opposites of samurai as possible.
(Note: at the moment of writing I haven't found textures for the pirates. Or the ship. I am no artist and I remembered it a week deep.)
The captain stands on the bridge of his ship and orders his underlings to attack. He prioritizes summoning more minions after Juki kills the previous wave to prevent him from finding his way up the bridge (and to keep ammo flowing).
After the captain ensures that he has someone to hide behind he attacks. By ordering a nearby ship to fire her cannons upon the samurai.
